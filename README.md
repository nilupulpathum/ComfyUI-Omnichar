# ComfyUI Omnichar Custom Node
### One .char format for consistent portable characters

Official `.char` integration with ComfyUI. Build a character once, use it across image and
video models. Same face, cloths & body across every model. 
Currently supports: Minimax H3, Krea2, Flux2 dev, klein9B & 4B.

A `.char` holds a character's reference images, its locked description, and often a trained LoRA.
Build one here with Encode Character, or in [Omnichar Studio](https://omnichar.org) on your own GPU
or [Omnichar Cloud](https://cloud.omnichar.org). The same file then feeds FLUX.2, MiniMax H3,
Krea 2, Qwen-Image 2.1 and anything else that takes references.

## Features

- **Character Files**: Open a `.char` built in Omnichar Studio or Cloud
- **Reference Images**: One batch, or one per numbered slot, both from the same resolved set
- **Positions Kept**: Reference order is preserved, because a prompt addresses images by number
- **Conditioning**: Wire a CLIP to get conditioning straight out, or take the prompt as text
- **Trained LoRA**: Applied to MODEL and CLIP when the character carries one
- **Build Characters**: Encode face, body and wardrobe references into a new `.char`, three slots each
- **Python Library**: Omnichar's standalone package for `.char` integration, no dependencies

## Requirements

- ComfyUI
- Python 3.10+
- `omnichar-sdk` (installed from `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Go to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omnichar/ComfyUI-Omnichar
   cd ComfyUI-Omnichar
   ```

3. Install the reader:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Restart ComfyUI

## Where Characters Live

Put `.char` files in `ComfyUI/models/characters/`. The loader lists whatever is there.

To share one folder with Omnichar Studio, set `INLINE_CHARACTERS_DIR` to its characters directory
and both read the same files.

## Nodes

| Node | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Load Character | `char`, `char_path` | `char` |
| Decode Character | `char`, `style`, `clip`, `prompt`, `arch`, `max_references`, `size_from`, `fit` | `conditioning`, `references`, `refs`, `sheet`, `prompt` |
| Character Reference | `refs`, `index` | `image`, `role`, `count` |
| Character References Split | `refs` | `image_0` to `image_4`, `count` |
| Character Reference Latent | `conditioning`, `refs`, `vae`, `size_from`, `fit` | `conditioning`, `images` |
| Apply Character LoRA | `model`, `clip`, `char`, `strength`, `arch`, `min_key_coverage` | `model`, `clip` |
| Encode Character | `name`, `description`, `resolution`, `face`/`body`/`cloths` (3 slots each) | `char` |
| Save Character | `char`, `filename`, `overwrite` | `path` |

## Guide

A character is a few reference images plus a description. Encode Character sorts them by role,
so face comes first and the prompt numbers follow that order.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="workflows/images_sia/face.png" width="110"></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="workflows/images_sia/body.jpg" width="110"></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="workflows/images_sia/cloth1.jpg" width="110"></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="workflows/images_sia/cloth2.jpg" width="110"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><code>face</code></td>
    <td align="center"><code>body</code></td>
    <td align="center"><code>cloths</code></td>
    <td align="center"><code>cloths_2</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Those four go into Encode Character, which writes `sia.char`. Save Character puts it in
`ComfyUI/models/characters/`, and Load Character picks it up from there.

Decode Character turns a character into a prompt and a resolved reference list. Models
that take one batch read `references`. Models with numbered slots, like MiniMax H3, take `refs` into
a Character References Split node, or a Character Reference node per slot. Edit models that read references as latents, like FLUX.2, take
`refs` into a Character Reference Latent node on both the positive and the negative conditioning.

Models whose text encoder takes reference images in its own slots, like Qwen-Image 2.1
(`image_1` through `image_10`) and Krea 2, use the `qwen` prompt style on Decode Character,
which addresses positions as `<image1>`, `<image2>` and so on. Wire the Split outputs, or one
Character Reference node per slot, into the model's text encoder image inputs. For more slots
than Split covers, use a Character Reference node per slot.

### Workflows

- [Build a `.char`](workflows/character_encode.json) from face, body and wardrobe references
- [FLUX.2 Klein 9B](workflows/flux_klein_9b_image_char.json), references as latents, to an image
- [MiniMax H3](workflows/minimax_h3_char_video.json), references in numbered slots, to a video
- [Qwen-Image 2.1](workflows/qwen_image_2_1_char_image.json), references in text encoder slots, to an image
- [Krea 2 Turbo](workflows/krea2_turbo_char_image.json), references in text encoder slots, to an image

## Python Library

Omnichar's standalone package for `.char` integration. Install it anywhere, not only in ComfyUI:

```bash
pip install omnichar-sdk
```

See [packages/omnichar-sdk/README.md](packages/omnichar-sdk/README.md).

## License

`packages/omnichar-sdk/` is Apache-2.0, so closed-source tools can read `.char` files.
Everything else is GPL-3.0-or-later, because ComfyUI is.
